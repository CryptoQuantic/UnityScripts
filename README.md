# UnityScripts
As I learn Unity3d, I often find myself googling around to learn how to do a specific thing. (For example, how do I draw a line on the screen using mouse clicks?)

As I learn things I like to make small, documented demo scripts that I can refer back to later.

This repo is a collection of those scripts.
